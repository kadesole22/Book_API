# Book_API
This project is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot that allows for managing a collection of authors and their books. It supports full CRUD operations, leverages Spring Data JPA for database interaction, and includes integration tests for endpoints. Ideal for learning how to structure and test a basic Spring Boot application.
